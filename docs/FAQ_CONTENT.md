## Page 1: General FAQ (doo.co/faq)

### What is DooCoins?

DooCoins is a family rewards app that helps parents teach children responsibility, goal-setting, and good habits. Parents create tasks and rewards, children complete tasks to earn virtual DooCoins, and spend them on rewards they care about. There are two apps — DooCoins Parent (for parents) and DooCoins Kids (a companion app for children).

### Is DooCoins free?

Yes! DooCoins is free to download and use. The free version includes unlimited children, tasks, and rewards — all stored locally on your device with no account required. For families who want more, the optional Family+ subscription unlocks premium features.

### What is Family+?

Family+ is our premium subscription for $2.99/month. It includes:

- **Kids App Access** — Connect the DooCoins Kids companion app so children can manage tasks and rewards on their own device
- **Cloud Sync** — Sync your data securely across all your devices
- **Push Notifications** — Get instant alerts when your child completes a task or claims a reward
- **Family Sharing** — Share children with co-parents, grandparents, or caregivers
- **ToDoos** — One-off tasks that archive automatically when completed
- **Weekly Allowances** — Automatic recurring coin payments
- **Routines** — Group tasks together (e.g. "Morning Routine")
- **Unlimited Transaction History** — The free version shows the last 20 transactions per child; Family+ removes this limit

### Are DooCoins a real cryptocurrency?

No. DooCoins are a virtual currency within the app. Their value is decided by each family — we suggest roughly 10 cents per DooCoin as a starting point, but it's completely up to you.

### How do I recover my account?

Family+ accounts are secured with Internet Identity. If you need to recover your account, you will need the recovery phrase you set up when creating your Internet Identity. Visit [internetcomputer.org/internet-identity](https://internetcomputer.org/internet-identity) for recovery instructions.

Free tier accounts are stored locally on your device and do not have a login, so there is no account to recover. We recommend upgrading to Family+ if you'd like cloud backup and multi-device access.

### How do I delete my account?

**Free tier:** Your data is stored locally on your device. Deleting the app will remove all your data.

**Family+ subscribers:** To delete your account and all associated cloud data, please contact us at [hello@doo.co](mailto:hello@doo.co) and we will process your request. To cancel your subscription, go to your Apple ID settings and manage your subscriptions from there.

### What technology is DooCoins built on?

DooCoins is a native iOS app available on the App Store. Premium data is synced securely via the Internet Computer (ICP) blockchain, providing decentralised cloud storage with no traditional server infrastructure.

### Where can I get support or provide feedback?

We'd love to hear from you! Whether you have a question, found a bug, or have a feature suggestion, please reach out to us at [hello@doo.co](mailto:hello@doo.co).

5. **Set goals** — On the rewards screen, tap the menu icon (three dots) on a reward and select "Set as goal" to set it as your child's savings target.
6. **Claim rewards** — When your child has earned enough DooCoins, tap the menu icon (three dots) on the reward and select "Claim", or tap the Claim button on the balance card.

### Do I need to create an account?

No. The free version works immediately with no sign-up or login required. Your data is stored locally on your device.

If you subscribe to Family+, you'll sign in with Internet Identity to enable cloud sync across devices. Internet Identity uses passkey authentication — no usernames or passwords to remember.

### How does the free version work?

The free version gives you everything you need to get started:

- Unlimited children, tasks, and rewards
- Track each child's coin balance
- Set goals so kids can see their progress
- View the last 20 transactions per child
- Works completely offline
- No account or login required

All data is stored locally on your device. The free version is single-device only.

### What is Family+ and what do I get?

Family+ is the premium subscription ($2.99/month) that unlocks the full family experience:

- **Kids App** — Let your children use the DooCoins Kids companion app on their own device
- **Approval Requests** — Receive task completion and reward claim requests from your child's device
- **Push Notifications** — Get instant alerts for requests and approvals
- **Cloud Sync** — Your data syncs securely across all your devices
- **Family Sharing** — Share children with co-parents, grandparents, or caregivers
- **ToDoos** — One-off tasks that archive when done
- **Weekly Allowances** — Automatic recurring coin payments
- **Routines** — Group tasks together (e.g. "Morning Routine")

You can subscribe from within the app. Apple Family Sharing is supported.

### How do I create tasks and rewards?

**Tasks** (how children earn DooCoins):
1. Tap on a child from the home screen
2. Tap the tasks icon in the bottom navigation
3. Tap the plus (+) button
4. Enter a task name and DooCoin value, then tap "Add"
5. To edit or delete a task, tap the menu icon (three dots) on the task

**Rewards** (how children spend DooCoins):
1. Tap the rewards icon (star) in the bottom navigation
2. Tap the plus (+) button
3. Enter a reward name and DooCoin value, then tap "Add"
4. To edit or delete a reward, tap the menu icon (three dots) on the reward

The value of a DooCoin is up to you. We find it works well to set roughly 10 cents = 1 DooCoin, but choose whatever works for your family.

### How do I approve tasks?

There are two ways to approve tasks:

- **Manually:** On the tasks screen, tap the menu icon (three dots) on a task and select "Approve". The DooCoins will be added to your child's balance.
- **Via requests (Family+):** If your child uses the Kids App, they can request task approval. Tap the bell icon in the Parent App to see pending requests, then tap to approve or decline.

### How do I invite my child to the Kids App?

The Kids App is a Family+ feature. To invite a child:

1. On the home screen, tap the menu icon (three dots) on your child's name and select "Invite"
2. A **magic code** (4-digit PIN) will be displayed — this code expires after 60 minutes
3. A QR code is also shown — scan it with your child's device camera to download the Kids App from the App Store
4. Once the app is installed, open it and enter the magic code

Your child will stay logged in unless they log out. If they do, you'll need to generate a new magic code from the Parent App.

### How do I share a child with a co-parent or caregiver?

Family Sharing is a Family+ feature that lets multiple adults manage the same child. To share:

1. Tap the menu icon (three dots) on your child's name on the home screen and select "Share"
2. Send the share link, QR code, or magic code to the other adult
3. The other adult opens the link, signs in with Internet Identity, and gains access to the shared child

Shared adults get full access to manage tasks, approve requests, and view the child's balance and history.

### What are ToDoos, Allowances, and Routines?

These are premium earning types available with Family+:

- **ToDoos** — One-off tasks (e.g. "Tidy the garage") that automatically archive once completed and approved. Unlike regular tasks, they don't stay on the task list.
- **Weekly Allowances** — Automatic recurring DooCoin payments added to your child's balance each week. Great for teaching regular income concepts.
- **Routines** — A group of tasks bundled together (e.g. "Morning Routine" might include "Brush teeth", "Make bed", "Get dressed"). Children complete the full routine to earn the coins.

### What is the DooCoins Kids App?

DooCoins Kids is the companion app for children. It lets kids see their tasks, request task completion, track their DooCoin balance, and claim rewards — all from their own device. Parents stay in control through the Parent App, where they approve or decline all requests.

The Kids App is designed for children and works great on both iPhones and iPads.

### How do I install the Kids App?

The Kids App is available on the App Store but is not searchable — it's accessed via a QR code from the Parent App. Here's how:

1. In the Parent App, tap the menu icon (three dots) on your child's name and select "Invite"
2. Scan the QR code with your child's device camera to open the App Store listing
3. Download and install DooCoins Kids

Alternatively, you can download it directly from the [App Store](https://apps.apple.com/app/doocoins-kids/id6756782298).

The Kids App requires a Family+ subscription in the Parent App.

### How does my child log in?

The Kids App uses a simple 4-digit magic code instead of usernames and passwords:

1. In the Parent App, tap the menu icon (three dots) on your child's name and select "Invite"
2. A magic code will be displayed — share this with your child
3. Your child enters the code in the Kids App to log in

The code expires after 60 minutes, so enter it promptly. Once logged in, your child stays signed in until they manually log out. If they do log out, simply generate a new magic code from the Parent App.

### How does the Kids App work?

Once logged in, your child can:

- **View Tasks** — See all their assigned tasks. Tap the tick icon next to a task to send a completion request to the parent.
- **View Rewards** — See all available rewards. If they have enough DooCoins, tap the tick icon to send a claim request. If they don't have enough yet, they can tap the target icon to set it as their savings goal.
- **Track Balance** — See their current DooCoin balance and progress toward their goal.
- **View Transactions** — See a history of earned and spent DooCoins.

All task completions and reward claims require parent approval in the Parent App.

### Does the Kids App require a subscription?

Yes. The Kids App is a Family+ feature, included with the $2.99/month subscription in the Parent App. The Kids App itself is free to download — the subscription is managed entirely through the Parent App.

### What notifications will my child receive?

With push notifications enabled, your child will receive alerts when:

- A task completion request is approved or declined
- A reward claim is approved
- Their DooCoin balance changes

Notifications help keep children engaged and informed without needing to constantly check the app.
